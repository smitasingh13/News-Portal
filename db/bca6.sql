We will stop at nothing to stamp out these dangerous gangs,\" he said.\r\n\r\nLed by the police and supported by the UK\'s National Crime Agency (NCA), Downing Street says the task force will consist of officers with extensive experience in undertaking grooming gang investigations.\r\n\r\nThey will provide critical support to forces countrywide to root out grooming gangs and put more perpetrators behind bars. Data analysts will work alongside the task force using cutting-edge data and intelligence, including police-recorded ethnicity data, to identify the types of criminals who carry out these offences.\r\n\r\n\"This will include better data on the make-up of grooming gangs, including ethnicity, to make sure suspects cannot hide behind cultural sensitivities as a way to evade justice,\" Downing Street said.\r\n\r\nIt follows Ms Braverman\'s announcement to bring in \"mandatory reporting\" for adults working with children if they suspect or identify that a child is being abused.\r\n\r\nMandatory reporting was a key recommendation in a crucial Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse.\r\n\r\n\"The protection of children is a collective effort. Every adult must be supported to call out child sexual abuse without fear,\" Ms Braverman said.\r\n\r\n\"And the despicable abusers must be brought to justice. They should not be able to hide. And they must face the full force of the law for their crimes,\" the senior Indian-origin Cabinet minister said.\r\n\r\n\"That\'s why I\'m introducing a mandatory reporting duty and launching a call for evidence. We must address the failures identified by the inquiry and take on board the views of the thousands of victims and survivors who contributed to its findings,\" she added.\r\n\r\nOver the weekend, Ms Braverman described the issue as one of the biggest scandals left unchallenged for too long.\r\n\r\n\"What we\'ve seen is a practice whereby vulnerable, white, English girls, sometimes in care, sometimes who are in challenging circumstances, being pursued and raped and drugged and harmed by gangs of British Pakistani, men who\'ve worked in child abuse rings or networks,\" she told \'Sky News\'.\r\n\r\nAlongside the new task force and mandatory reporting consultation process, the UK government has also pledged to make sure grooming gang members and their ring leaders receive the toughest possible sentences.\r\n\r\nThe legislation will be introduced to make being the leader of or involved in a grooming gang a statutory aggravating factor during sentencing.\r\n\r\n\"Grooming gangs are a scourge on our society, and I want to send a clear message to anyone who exploits vulnerable children that they will face the full weight of the law,\" UK Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said.\r\n\r\nThe British government said it is also bolstering support for the children\'s charity - National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) - which runs a whistleblowing helpline and a public helpline, giving professionals and members of the public avenues to raise concerns about children, or about child grooming in their community.', '2023-04-03', 'World', 'WhatsApp Image 2023-04-04 at 12.43.39 AM.jpeg', 'Smita Singh'),

This, said BJP strategists at the time, was a playbook adopted from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to counter anti-incumbency, where \'Hindutva\' often trumped caste calculations and the individual influence of MLAs.\r\n\r\nData from the 2023 election shows that the BJP failed in both accounts, by driving the Lingayats towards the Congress and by fostering a situation where rebels ate into BJP\'s votes.\r\n\r\nPlayUnmute\r\nFullscreen\r\nCongress\'s caste calculations trump BJP\'s\r\n\r\nIt is often hard to infer post-election data as any sweep by a party automatically translates to an uptick in the performance of candidates irrespective of caste. In general, Congress\'s AHINDA tactic (a Kannada abbreviation for focusing on minorities, Other Backward Classes, and Dalits) seemed to have worked, with the party scoring high strike rates among candidates from these communities. It is only among Brahmin candidates that the BJP has a considerable strike rate.\r\n* Considered here as castes and classes eligible for Karnataka government\'s Category 1 and 2a reservations for Other Backward Classes\r\n\r\nJust as impressive is the Congress show in Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes seats, where it focussed on candidates from the SC-Right community (who are largely agrarian) to which Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge belongs. In 51 SC/ST reserved constituencies, the Congress gained 15 constituencies, while the BJP lost 10 and JD(S), four when compared to the 2018 election. The Congress\'s vote share in SC/ST constituencies surged by nearly 9 percentage points in these constituencies.Lingayats seem to flock to Congress; BJP gains with Vokkaligas\r\n\r\nThe constituencies where the BJP and Congress fielded candidates from the same caste can give a broad (albeit, imperfect) sense of voter preference across castes. That is, if candidates from the two major parties are from an OBC community, it can be assumed that the OBC community forms a sizeable presence in the constituency. Voting patterns here can be a proxy for determining the party that was preferred by these communities.\r\n\r\nIn 102 constituencies where the Congress and BJP fielded candidates from the same caste (or, in the case of Dalit and tribal communities, from the same sub-caste), the Congress gained 32 seats, while the BJP lost 19 constituencies.\r\n\r\nIt does seem that the key to the Congress\'s success was the performance of its Lingayat candidates, as well as those from constituencies reserved for SC/ST candidates.\r\n\r\nNearly three-quarters of the Congress\'s Lingayat leaders have won, primarily in North Karnataka. Through the election campaign, Congress built a narrative that the BJP had betrayed and ignored the Lingayat vote base by sidelining former Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and denying tickets to former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar and former Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi. Though Shettar lost by a large margin, the narrative seemed to have found some traction.\r\n\r\nA stark indicator of this is in 38 constituencies where Congress\'s Lingayat candidates were pitted against Lingayat candidates from the BJP.\r\n\r\nThe BJP has suffered major reversals in these constituencies: winning just eight in 2023 compared to 21 in 2018. The beneficiary was the Congress - winning 29 in 2023 compared to just 14 in 2018. In 2023, the JD(S) won just one of these constituencies.\r\n\r\nComparing constituencies where BJP, Congress candidates were from same caste.\r\nThis gain is seen in vote shares too. The constituencies where both BJP and Congress candidates had selected Lingayat candidates can be assumed to be those with a sizeable Lingayat population. In 38 of these constituencies, the Congress\'s vote share increased by 7 percentage points, far above its overall vote share in the 2023 elections.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, in an election where the BJP has seen almost no gain in vote share, it made major strides in the Vokkaliga heartland of Southern Karnataka. Here, it won an additional constituency and saw a 9.5 percentage points increase in vote share. This is clearly at the expense of the JD(S) which lost a similar quantum of vote share in Vokkaliga-dominated constituencies (where all three parties fielded candidates from the Vokkaliga community).\r\n\r\nThis could be due to multiple factors that signify the BJP\'s increasing presence in Southern Karnataka, where it has been traditionally weak. For one, many JD(S) incumbent MLAs and party leaders have hopped to the BJP in the past four years. Second, the BJP\'s intense campaigning focused on Southern Karnataka - including a massive ', '2023-05-15', 'Politics', '6lnja008_pm-modi-bengaluru-karnataka-pti_625x300_06_May_23.png', 'Neeta  Sharma'),

The search bar at the top of the app and home page in recent years have become the default gateway for millions of shoppers seeking to find a specific product. More than half of US shoppers say they start product searches on Amazon.com, a higher share than Google, according a survey conducted earlier this year by Jungle Scout, a maker of software for sellers on Amazon.\r\nEarly deployments of generative AI by Microsoft, Alphabet\'s Google and others have been beset by errors in response to basic questions.

Google\'s annual developer conference for 2023 is quite focussed on artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the firm announced several new AI-powered features that are coming to services like search, Google Maps, Google Photos, and Gmail. Some of these features will be rolled out to customers in the coming weeks, while some will only be available later this year, Google said, while reiterating its \"bold and responsible\" approach to updating its products.\r\n\r\nThe first product from Google that is set to get an AI-backed upgrade is Gmail, the company announced during the Google I/O keynote. The company says it is expanding on its Smart Reply and Smart Compose features, which also rely on AI, into a new tool called \"Help me write\" that will roll out to Google Workspace users in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nUsers can type in a prompt of an email they want to compose, and the tool will use a powerful generative model to quickly pull data from their Google account to generate a personalised email. These drafts can also be refined by the user, or automatically expanded using an \"Elaborate\" option. These features will start to roll out as part of Workspace updates, according to Google.\r\nGoogle Photos, first introduced at Google I/O in 2015, has received several AI-powered features over the years that allow users to search for specific objects or people in their photo library. The company also offers a Magic Eraser tool on its Pixel smartphones, allowing users to remove people and objects from photos using AI — users on non-Pixel smartphones can also use this tool, with a Google One subscription.\r\nA new Magic Editor tool for Google Photos was unveiled on Wednesday, and the company claims it can add missing details in images where objects are partially visible, move subjects in an image after it has been captured, and maintain a consistent look across the image while editing a particular section. Google says Magic Editor for Google Photos will arrive later in 2023.\r\nThe company is also adding more AI capabilities to Google Maps, with a new \"Immersive View for routes\" feature that can give users who are walking, cycling, or driving, a bird\'s eye view of the route, along with details of the traffic, air quality, weather, and visual indications of how these might change throughout the day. Google Maps\' new Immersive View for routes will be available in 15 cities — including London, New York, Tokyo, and San Francisco — by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nGoogle\'s search app is also getting an upgrade, as is the desktop browser search experience. The company has been scrambling to compete with Microsoft\'s upgraded Bing, which runs on OpenAI\'s GPT-4 technology. Using Google Bard, the search giant will offer users a conversational AI experience, that has now been opened to all users without a waitlist. The new Google search with generative AI can be enabled via a Labs setting and users can join a waitlist to test all the features offered by Bard-powered Google search, such as smarter shopping and follow up questions.

After months — years, even — of speculation, Messi on Wednesday finally revealed his decision to join a Miami franchise that has been led by another global football icon, David Beckham, since its inception but has yet to make any real splashes on the field.</p><p>That likely will soon change. One of Inter Miami’s owners, Jorge Mas, tweeted out a photo of a darkly silhouetted Messi jersey shortly before the Argentinian great revealed his decision in interviews with Spanish news outlets Mundo Deportivo and Sport.</p><p>It was widely believed that Messi eventually would choose to play for Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, following longtime rival Cristiano Ronaldo to a nation where some clubs now are funded by the state’s sovereign wealth fund. Going back to Barcelona, a storied franchise where he spent most of his career, was another possibility.</p><p>But in the end, he made the call that surprised many.<a href=\"https://zeenews.india.com/football/breaking-lionel-messi-to-join-inter-miami-after-parting-ways-with-psg-2618881.html\">Messi is joining MLS.</a> He said in the interviews Wednesday that some final details still need to be worked out, but that he has made the call to ‘continue my path’ in Miami. “After winning the World Cup and not being able to return to Barcelona, it was my turn to go to the league of the United States to live football in another way,” Messi said.</p><p>He didn’t take the money. He didn’t choose the memories. He picked Miami instead. Messi’s next matches are likely to be exhibitions with Argentina against Australia on June 15 at Beijing and at Indonesia in Jakarta four days later — and then his Inter Miami debut figures to be sometime in July.</p><p>“We are pleased that Lionel Messi has stated that he intends to join Inter Miami and Major League Soccer this summer,” read a statement from MLS. “Although work remains to finalize a formal agreement, we look forward to welcoming one of the greatest soccer players of all time to our league.”</p><p><b>Lionel Messi has nothing left to prove</b></p><p>The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner — the trophy given annually to the world’s best player — makes his move after two years with Paris Saint-Germain. At 35, Messi has nothing left to prove in the game and filled the only significant unchecked box on his resume back in December by leading Argentina to the World Cup title.</p><p>Messi has more than 800 goals in his career for club and country, making him one of the greatest scorers in the sport’s history. In more than 17 years of representing Argentina on the international stage, he has scored 102 goals against 38 different national team opponents — 16 of those goals coming on U.S. soil. He scored twice in last year’s World Cup final against France, a match that ended 3-3 with Argentina prevailing 4-2 on penalty kicks.</p><p>He has been to the absolute mountaintop of the game. He is a four-time Champions League winner and his 129 goals in the top club competition are second to Ronaldo\'s 140. Messi has won 10 La Liga titles and two Ligue 1 championships, seven Copa del Reys and three Club World Cups plus a Copa América and Olympic gold medal for Argentina.</p><p><b>Inter Miami are struggling in MLS</b></p><p>And now he comes to MLS, and a team that is struggling — last place in the Eastern Conference, just a few days removed from the firing of coach Phil Neville (who was hand-picked by Beckham two years ago). Messi’s decision to play in the US might be the biggest boost ever for American football on the pro stage.</p><p>Some of the game’s biggest names — Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer, Thierry Henry and Beckham himself — have come to the US toward the end of their careers, but landing a player still no worse than near the pinnacle of his game and just a few months removed from hoisting a World Cup is simply huge.</p><p>It took months of negotiations with MLS, the Miami ownership, Adidas and even Apple getting involved in a creative pitch to bring Messi to Miami’s pitch. Apple — which is a broadcast partner of MLS — announced Tuesday that it will show a still-untitled four-part documentary series “featuring exclusive behind-the-scenes access to global superstar Lionel Messi. ... In his own words, Messi tells the definitive story of his incredible career with the Argentina national football team, providing an intimate and unprecedented look at his quest for a legacy-defining World Cup victory.”</p><p>And now, his story will have a Miami chapter. David Beckham-owned Inter Miami needed six years from inception to playing its first match, and its first four seasons have been less than stellar.</p><p>Messi is joining a team that sits last in the Eastern Conference and just fired its coach. It has made the playoffs in two of its first three seasons but has yet to finish a season with a winning record or even a positive goal differential.Messi could change that in an instant. In a flash, he becomes the biggest name in MLS and makes everything Miami does newsworthy. Barcelona released a statement saying Jorge Messi, the player’s father, told the club president Joan Laporta of the decision to go to Miami and wished him well.</p><p>“President Laporta understood and respected Messi’s decision to want to compete in a league with fewer demands, further away from the spotlight and the pressure he has been subject to in recent years,” the statement from Barcelona said.</p><p>His decision ends what has been a wild saga. Barcelona made Messi a superstar, but the financial issues that forced the team to letting him go two years ago still remain an issue.</p><p>“I heard that they’d have to sell players or lower players’ salaries and the truth is, I didn’t want to go through that,” Messi said on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThere are no financial issues with Saudi Arabia, and speculation that he would end up there intensified when Messi made an unauthorized trip to the kingdom. PSG suspended him and some fans turned on him, serenading him with jeers toward the end of his season with the French club.</p>', '2023-06-08', 'Sports', '1215916-messimiami.png', 'Neeta  Sharma'),

The in-house Massive Entertainment leads development on the game, which lets players chart an intergalactic heist in the Outer Rim, as the Empire gradually expands its control across the galaxy. Star Wars Outlaws was first announced at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 11 and is slated to release sometime in 2024, across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S/X.</p><br><p>The lengthy gameplay footage opens with Nix, an adorably furry axolotl-like alien stealing a rock-shaped artefact and handing it over to its partner-in-crime Kay Vess (Humberly González), a cunning scoundrel who has a bounty placed on her head after a job went wrong. During a Ubisoft press session, Julian Gerighty, creative director of Star Wars Outlaws claimed that the two are inseparable companions and that they rely on each other\'s skills to survive. It\'s a bit similar to the BD-1 droid from <a href=\"https://www.gadgets360.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor-114935\">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, where you can command Nix to press certain buttons or perform actions that would distract enemies.

While the blaster is her primary weapon, she can often pick up random weaponry laying around to make short work of enemies.</p><br><p>Star Wars Outlaws is an original arc set between <a href=\"https://www.gadgets360.com/entertainment/star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-movie-106893\">Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gadgets360.com/entertainment/star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-movie-106894\">Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</a> movies, taking Kay and Nix on a journey across the underworld to take risky contracts and manage complex relationships with crime syndicates, hoping to pull the greatest heist in the galaxy. Being an open-world affair, the gameplay trailer also offers a look at Kay\'s traversal option, which is a hovering motorcycle that has a few tricks up its gears. In addition to taking players from point A to point B, it comes equipped with a nitrous booster, giving a short burst of speed to evade enemies or to simply reach the destination quicker. Additionally, it appears as if you can briefly slow down time while riding the vehicle — akin to Dead Eye from <a href=\"https://www.gadgets360.com/red-dead-redemption-2-12219\">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> — to target foes and unload a barrage of bullets into them.</p><br><p>“In our game, you\'ll be able to discover a galaxy of opportunities as you explore distinct locations across the Outer Rim, that offer a range of different biomes, inhabitants, rewarding finds, impactful stories, and diversity of gameplay” Gerighty explained in the exclusive press footage. Star Wars Outlaws will be largely spread across three key experiences — dense cities bustling with NPCs and cantinas, vast open-world environments for exploration, and a space setting where you\'ll engage in intense dogfights and even travel across the hyperspace. You\'ll pilot your very own ship, the Trailblazer, which to Kay, means “freedom and it\'s what allows her to finally escape and embark on this journey.”</p><br><p>Star Wars Outlaws will release sometime in 2024, across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S/X.</p>', '2023-06-13', 'Entertainment', 'star_wars_outlaws_gameplay_1686642744485.jpg', 'Manas Mitul'),

He did it to maintain a balance among the old and new guards in NCP,” Saamana said.</p><br><p>The editorial also pointed out that the NCP has already lost its national party status.</p><p></p><p>“Although Sharad Pawar had said that the appointment of two \'working presidents\' is because of the vastness of the country, no other regional parties have made such appointments. It may be true,” the Sena said.</p><br><p>Referring to Mr Pawar\'s announcement to resign as NCP chief last month and subsequent withdrawal of the decision, Saamana said it was clear that Ms Sule would have got the reins of the party.</p><br><p>\"But what message Pawar is trying to give by appointing Praful Patel as another working president? Patel might have been elevated to avoid allegations of dynastic politics in NCP with Sule\'s appointment to the position,\" Saamana said.</p><br><p>The editorial said there was no mention of any new responsibility to Ajit Pawar in the latest decisions taken at the NCP meeting in New Delhi.</p><br><p>\"Rumours say that Ajit daada is disappointed. But he is an important player in Maharashtra\'s politics and he is not keen on working outside the state,” it said.</p><br><p>Ajit Pawar is the leader of the opposition in the state Assembly and a faction of MLAs close to him are said to be soft on the BJP, the Sena said.</p><br><p>It said the image of Ajit Pawar- nephew of Sharad Pawar- became negative when he took oath as deputy chief minister with Devendra Fadnavis of BJP as the chief minister in November 2019.</p><br><p>However, Ajit resigned after three days and returned to the NCP fold, which paved the way for the formation of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) with Shiv Sena (undivided) joining hands with NCP and Congress.</p><br><p>\"Ajit Pawar will have to take a lot of effort to remove the blot (on his image),” the edit said.</p><br><p>The Shiv Sena also made a veiled reference to the Pawar senior saying he has not made any big changes in NCP but has just initiated a process for the same.</p><br><p>“Supriya Sule will have to pass the test.
